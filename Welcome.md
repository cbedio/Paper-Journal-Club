# Welcome to the Paper Journal Club

Welcome to the Paper Journal Club! Our goal is to create an engaging environment where we discuss recent and influential research papers. Every meeting focuses on a specific paper, and you can join in to share your insights.

Meetings occur at the University of Surrey at 4pm on a Tuesdays.
